# Job Fitment Scoring Project

This project implements a Job Fitment Scoring System that automatically evaluates a candidate's compatibility with job descriptions. It leverages machine learning and NLP to generate structured data from JDs, filters candidates based on mandatory skills, and computes similarity-based fitment scores using Milvus and Sentence Transformers.

## üöÄ Features

- Extracts structured information (skills, experience, etc.) from unstructured job descriptions.
- Filters candidates from PostgreSQL based on required criteria.
- Computes fitment scores using Sentence-BERT embeddings and Milvus similarity search.
- Scalable and modular codebase.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: DSFactory, dspy, sentence-transformers
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Vector Store**: Milvus
- **Environment**: `.env` for DB and Milvus URIs
